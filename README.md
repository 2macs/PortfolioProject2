# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game
The goal of this webpage is to enable a player to play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock against a computer. RPSLS is a game of chance whereby a player selects an option and then plays against a random selection made by the computer. The creation of the game is attributed to Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. The game was famously used in the TV series 'The Big Bang Theory' to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV between Sheldon and Raj in the episode "The Lizard-Spock Expansion".
